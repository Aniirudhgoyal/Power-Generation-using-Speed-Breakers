# Power-Generation-using-Speed-Breakers

Overview

This project explores the feasibility of generating power from vehicles passing over speed-breakers. The system converts the mechanical energy generated by the vehicle's weight into electrical energy using a rack and pinion mechanism. The project demonstrates an innovative approach to sustainable energy generation by harnessing wasted energy from everyday traffic.



Key Features:

1. Design and Conceptualization
A FreeCAD model was created to design the speed breaker and finalize component dimensions. The mechanical structure involves a rack and pinion mechanism for energy conversion.

2. Material Selection
Materials were carefully chosen for their ease of handling and mechanical strength. Wood was used for the base, metal for the head, and acrylic for the gears, ensuring precision through laser cutting.

3. Power Generation
The system generates power through a DC dynamo connected to the gear assembly, which is activated when vehicles pass over the speed breaker, powering LED lights. This principle can be extended to power streetlights.

4. Assembly
The project involved the assembly of the speed-breaker, including wooden columns, metal sheets for the head, springs for retracting motion, and gears for converting mechanical energy into electrical energy.




Methodology:
-Design: Conceptualized and modeled the design using FreeCAD, and determined suitable dimensions for each component through trial and error.

-Material Selection: Used wood for the base and support, and metal for the speed-breaker head and gears, ensuring durability and ease of assembly.

-Assembly: Assembled the structure using L-clamps, nuts, bolts, and springs for motion and energy generation.

-Power Generation: Connected a DC dynamo to generate electricity and power LEDs when the head is depressed by passing vehicles.





Applications:

-Urban Integration: Implement in urban areas to power streetlights and traffic signals.

-Rural Electrification: Use in rural areas to generate electricity for local infrastructure.

-Electric Vehicle Charging: Adapt the system to serve as charging stations for electric vehicles.

-Disaster Preparedness: Install in disaster-prone areas to provide critical power during emergencies.
